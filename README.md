Advanced capabilities with modular Add-ons system. Using PubNub BLOCKS and Socket.IO/Node.JS add-ons for user-mention notifications and data privacy with encryption.


```
npm install gulp -g
npm install bower -g
```

```
cd chat-sdk/sdk/
npm install
cd ../../realtime.js
bower install
npm install
```


* Requires realtime.js
* End result is minified js file in /dist
* Would be cool if this also worked on back end
