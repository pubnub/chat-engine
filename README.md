# Under Development

## Running Anything

1. Must have ```server.js``` running.
2. If working with history, deploy the code in ```/functions``` to PubNub blocks. See ```/functions/readme.md```.

## Compiling

Run ```gulp``` to compile, but you should probably run ```gulp watch``` to get consistent changes.

## Running Tests

Run ```gulp test```.
