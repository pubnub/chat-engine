PubNub ChatEngine is an object-oriented event emitter based framework for building chat applications in Javascript. It reduces the time to build chat applications drastically and provides essential components like typing indicators, online presence monitoring and message history out of the box.

The real-time server component is provided by PubNub. ChatEngine is designed to be extensible and includes a plugin framework to make adding new features simple.

For more information on building chat applications with PubNub, see our 
[Chat Resource Center](http://www.pubnub.com/developers/chat-resource-center/).

# Documentation

You can find the full docs on [the documentation website](https://pubnub.github.io/chat-engine/).

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS
* Twitter Bootstrap
* jQuery

## PubNub Account Set Up

To set up ChatEngine on PubNub, one must first set up a PubNub Key. The following steps outlines how to manually set up a PubNub Key to work with ChatEngine client-side SDKs.

### Sign Up for a PubNub Account
If you don't already have an account, you can create one for free [here](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/).

### Set Up the REST API Service using PubNub Functions
The ChatEngine framework and client-side SDKs interact with a REST API service that runs as a PubNub Function. 

*You'll need to set up the function on your PubNub Account before you can use the SDKs.*

[Follow the ChatEngine Server Setup Instructions](https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine-server).

## Download Code

### Create a new NPM project

Since we'll be installing dependencies, it's helpful to create a new ```package.json``` to keep track of all of the packages we're going to install.

In your project directory, run this command to create a new package. Complete the interactive set up guide and we'll be ready to go.

```
npm init
```

That'll create a ```package.json``` in your project directory.

```json
{
  "name": "chat-engine-tutorial",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "An example PubNub ChatEngine Tutorial",
  "main": "index.js",
  "author": "Ian Jennings"
}
```

### Install PubNub ChatEngine

Alright, now for the part you've probably never done before! Install PubNub ChatEngine by running:

```sh
npm install chat-engine@latest --save
```

# Development

## Cloning

Clone repos (chat-engine and plugins).

All repos should be siblings of one another. This is required for rendering docs
properly.

```
chat-engine
chat-engine-desktop-notifications
chat-engine-emoji
chat-engine-examples
//...
```

## Setting up the Environment

```
nvm use v6
```

Run ```http-server``` from my ```/development``` directory which has all chat-engine repos:


```cd chat-engine```

```node server.js```

Load http://localhost:8080 in browser and navigate to /chat-engine-examples/jquery/kitchen-sink

## Compiling

Run ```gulp``` to compile, but you should probably run ```gulp watch``` to get consistent changes.

## Running Tests

You will need to assign environment variables ```PUB_KEY_0``` and ```SUB_KEY_0``` to your own PubNub keys. Add these variables into your ```.bashrc``` or ```.zshrc```.

```sh
# pubnub chatengine keys
export PUB_KEY_0="YOUR PUBNUB PUBLISH KEY"
export SUB_KEY_0="YOUR PUBNUB SUBSCRIBE KEY"
```

Then, in the root folder run:

```
gulp test
```

## Releasing a patch (chat engine and plugins)

```
npm version patch && git push origin master --tags
```
