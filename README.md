PubNub ChatEngine is an object oriented event emitter based framework for building chat applications in Javascript. It reduces the time to build chat applications drastically and provides essential components like typing indicators, online presence monitoring and message history out of the box.

The real time server component is provided by PubNub. ChatEngine is designed to be extensible and includes a plugin framework to make adding new features simple.

# 0.10 Alpha Preview Instructions

Thanks for testing the new version of ChatEngine. This branch is still under development and is subject to change. 0.10 includes many improvements and optimizations over 0.9:

- Online and offline events fire more reliablity.
- $.ready returns Me rather than the object {me}
- Document all emitted errors, provide more accurate namespacing for error events.
- $.online.join and $.online.leave reliablity fire in rooms with more than 20 users
- Chat config is now a single parameter object {autoConnect: false} rather than individual parameters. This makes it easier to design flags in the future
- .restoreState(ChatEngine.global) restores the user state from the kv-store before events are emitted. Works for both Chat and Search.
- Adds the ability to disable globalChannel preventing transactions for users who do not use it.
- State can be set within specific chats.
- Errors are properly caught by promise rejections.
- References to globalChannel are now called namespace.
- Message augmentation further isolated into plugin structure.
- PubNub HereNow only called a single time.

## Using the new version


### Update the PubNub Function Code

You'll need to update your ChatEngine PubNub Function to use the latest code found here. It would be wise to [use our account configuration tool to set up a new 0.9 app](https://www.pubnub.com/tutorials/chatengine/) and then copy and paste the new server code into it.

https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine-setup/blob/CHAT-354-no-global/src/functions/server.js

### Enable Presence Deltas

Enable Presence Deltas within your PubNub key configuration on https://admin.pubnub.com/. This can be found within your app and key settings.

### Update the SDK

You can install the new version of ChatEngine with ```npm install chat-engine@alpha``` which will return a version of 0.10.x. You can also use the jsdelivr link ```https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chat-engine@0.10.13/dist/chat-engine.min.js```.

### Migrate your client code

A migration guide from 0.9 to 0.10 is available here:

https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine/blob/0.10-alpha/migrate-0.9-0.10.md

### Documentation and Reference

The documentation within the repository is mostly up to date. Clone this repository and render it locally by running ```gulp serve_docs```.

### Examples

Updated examples can be found here:

https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine-examples/tree/CHAT-354-migration

Our [integration tests](https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine/blob/0.10-alpha/test/integration/main.test.js) are also passing and can be used as reference.

### Plugins

Plugins, plugin tests and examples, have been migrated or verified to work with 0.10. You can find them within a branch called ```chat-354```. Plugins can be compiled with ```chat-engine-plugin``` if needed. See this plugin branch for an example:

https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine-emoji/tree/chat-354

# Development

## Cloning

Clone repos (chat-engine and plugins).

All repos should be siblings of one another. This is required for rendering docs
properly.

```
chat-engine
chat-engine-desktop-notifications
chat-engine-emoji
chat-engine-examples
//...
```

## Setting up environment

```
nvm use v6
```

run ```http-server``` from my ```/development``` directory which has all chat-engine repos:


```cd chat-engine```

```node server.js```

load http://localhost:8080 in browser and navigate to /chat-engine-examples/jquery/kitchen-sink

## Compiling

Run ```gulp``` to compile, but you should probably run ```gulp watch``` to get consistent changes.

## Running Tests

You will need to assign environment variables ```PUB_KEY_0``` and ```SUB_KEY_0``` to your own PubNub keys. Add these variables into your ```.bashrc``` or ```.zshrc```.

```sh
# pubnub chatengine keys
export PUB_KEY_0="YOUR PUBNUB PUBLISH KEY"
export SUB_KEY_0="YOUR PUBNUB SUBSCRIBE KEY"
```

Then, in the root folder run:

```
gulp test
```

## PubNub Functions and Account Setup

You can find the scripts for the [PubNub Automagic Setup](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/chat-engine/getting-started) here:
[https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine-setup](https://github.com/pubnub/chat-engine-setup).

## Releasing a patch (chat engine and plugins)

```
npm version patch && git push origin master --tags
```
