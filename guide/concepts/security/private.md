## Private Chats

A user may want to make a private chat no other users can access. To do this,
create a new chat with the syntax:

```
let privChat = new Chat('private', {isPrivate: true});
```

The second parameter tells ChatEngine to lock down the chat and only make it
accessible to those who are invited.

## Inviting to Private Chats

In order to securely invite other users to the chat, the client can call
the {@link Chat#invite} method.

```js
otherUser = ChatEngine.global.users['ian'];
privChat.invite(otherUser);
```

This will send ```otherUser``` a secure invite to the {@link Chat} via {@link User#direct}.

## Receiving invites to Private Chats

You can get notified of invites by subscribing to the {@link Me#event:$"."invite $.invite} event.

```js
me.direct.on('$.invite', (payload) => {
    let privChat = new ChatEngine.Chat(payload.data.channel, {isPrivate: true}));
});
```
